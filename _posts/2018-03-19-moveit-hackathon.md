## My experience at the Moveit Hackathon in Guiyang, China

![moveit hackathon web]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/moveithackathon.png)


From the 09 to the 13 of March 2018 the event called [Moveit Hackathon](https://www.pixmoving.com/move-it) took part. I found about it at the [ROS discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/) channel as they chose to call it Move It, just like the [Motion planning framework](https://moveit.ros.org/) and it generated a bit of attention. Sounded cool, why not apply? I've participated in plenty of hackathons and robotics contests, so I should be fine.

It was defined as:

> Move-it is a hackathon for self-driving, aiming to build an affordable development platform(chassis) for self-driving, solving various engineering challenges along the process.

You can read more of what it was all about in the [website of the event](https://www.pixmoving.com/move-it) but my short description is:

> Get together a bunch of great engineers and hackers from all around the world to transform two platforms, a prototype car we called Coffee car and a Honda Civic 2016, from standard driven cars into fully autonomous self driven cars by using and publishing open source code and data. And more!

## The event day to day

### Day 1

#### Welcome event
The day started with a *Welcome event* where we discovered the **C-Zone Hackerspace**, a pretty cool place full of tools for us to use for this hackathon (3D printer, car tools, electronics...). It was a pretty big warehouse that some people said it may have been used in the past to manufacture pieces related to planes.

In the event some local figures gave a speech:
- Guiyang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Area representative
- Moveit developer community coordinator
- Vice mayor of Guiyang

They spoke in Chinese but were also translated just after for most of the participants that didn't speak Chinese.

Then [Scott C. Livingston](https://scottman.net/) (a participant that worked as a self driving engineer) gave a little speech trying to give some aim to the goals of the hackathon and describing the status of self driven cars. It seemed like he was going to be leading on what direction to go. (It wasn't in the end).

Then we had a few more speeches about:
- [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware) (by Prof. Yoshiki NINOMIYA), showed very cool results and status of the project
- [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) (by Apollo Senior Software Architect Jinghao Miao), showed cool stuff about their platform, even tho we didn't even give it a try
- Velodyne, kinda promo about the sensors that we all know, promised lower prices
- [Chris Anderson](https://diyrobocars.com/about/) from DIY Robocars had a skype call with us talking about the project

#### Getting started
Once the welcome event was over and we started having some lunch, we, the participants, got to know each other. The event was gonna be about 10 people, distributed in two teams of 5 in principle (that was the initial proposal on the call of the event). But we ended up being around 20 participants with many additions of people that lived in China so they had it easy to participate. And having teams *competing* made no sense anymore.

So we started chatting in a random fashion and we looked around to see what we had.

Hardware:
- Coffee car, a prototype car with all pieces exposed, and mostly all the datasheets available somehow (some stuff was only in Chinese).
- Honda Civic 2016
- Our laptops
- Velodynes
- MindVision Cameras
- [PANDACAN](https://github.com/commaai/panda) boards
- CANalyst-2 boards











### Wins!

### Failures...

### Lessons learnt (things we could have done better)
