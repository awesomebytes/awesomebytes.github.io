I'm a robotics engineer who loves to play with expensive toys. Currently pursuing a PhD at [The Magic Lab - Innovation and Enterprise Research Laboratory](http://themagiclab.org/) in the [Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology) at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/) in Sydney, Australia.

I previously worked at [PAL Robotics](http://www.pal-robotics.com/en/home/) and was a proud member of the robotics club in my former university [AESS](https://aess.upc.es/).

I did my bachelor in [Computer Science](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies) and my master in [Automatic Control and Robotics](https://mar.masters.upc.edu/en) both at [Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTECH](https://www.upc.edu/en).

### What do I do?
I work with robots, mostly humanoid ones. I do most of my work in Python. I love Python. And I use [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) for most of my projects (that are robot related).

I have a very broad experience from microcontroller programming all the way up to high level behaviour programming for robots in collaboration.

I like hacking stuff from time to time.

I like working in teams. I like trying new things and playing with new tech.

I'm also a climber and I love travelling.
